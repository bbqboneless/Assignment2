# Assignment2

For all the excercises of this assignment, the following commands were used:
  1.  gedit [FILENAME].c -> This was to open the C builder in order to be able to write the programs.
  2.  gcc -o [FILENAME] [FILENAME].c -> This was to allow the permissions to compile the files. However, for some of the files such as mypower.c, '-lm' was added at the       end of the command in order for the cmd to build the math libraries.
  3.  ./[FILENAME] -> This was for executing the file.

In the repository we have 6 files, which correspond to each and every excercise in the class presentation.
