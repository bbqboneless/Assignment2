# Assignment2

For all the excercises of this assignment, the following commands were used:
  1.  gedit [FILENAME].c -> This was to open the C builder in order to be able to write the programs.
  2.  gcc -o [FILENAME] [FILENAME].c -> This was to allow the permissions to compile the files. However, for some of the files such as mypower.c, '-lm' was added at the       end of the command in order for the cmd to build the math libraries.
  3.  ./[FILENAME] -> This was for executing the file.

In the repository we have 6 files, which correspond to each and every excercise in the class presentation. Excercises 1:4 are simple text used to practice the C language and how to manipulate strings. As for the assignment's excercises (5 and 6), it was a little bit more challenging.

  a.  As for Excercise 5, the mypower command, it was a bit challenging when splitting the string containing the values of the power and converting the values from 
      string to double. But in the end, it was a complete succes (I think).
  b.  As for Excercise 6, it was a little more quick. The comparisson was easier and it gave 0 for matching results, -1 when str1 was smaller than str2, and 1 when str1       larger than str2.
  
  Overall, all the excercises were understood and the examples were done as well. A picture containing the results of the execution of each program is provided as well.
